<p>That eventually turned into a bunch of degrees from my original

<p>I’m a member of way too many RCD community groups, been on the Campus

<p>The first one is Campus Champions: this was the second RCD community
that I joined about 5 years ago, the one that introduced me to Henry and
other folks via the Virtual Residency.</p>
<p>Campus Champions is one of the longest-running RCD communities,
starting around 2008 and formerly funded by NSF’s Extreme Science and
Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). It currently has over 800
members from every state, and it includes folks from every RCD role:
facilitators, software engineers, systems administrators, etc.</p>
<p>We’ve got an active mailing list and fairly active Slack, with two
regularly-scheduled calls each month. One call has a specific topic and
an invited speaker, while the other one is a more free-flowing community
chat over any topic of interest to the attendees. Sometimes we start
with something hot from the mailing list, other times from recent news
items.</p>
<p>One other advantage to Campus Champions is that even though we don’t
have direct ties to XSEDE’s followup project, ACCESS, the ACCESS team
does provide Campus Champions extra insight into their institutions’
usage of ACCESS resources, which can help you guide your researchers
toward more efficient usage or more suitable locations for their
work.</p>

<p>Another catch-all group similar to Campus Champions is the Campus
Research Computing Consortium, or CaRCC.</p>
<p>CaRCC has a pretty comprehensive structure of tracks, interest
groups, and working groups. These are all ad hoc and community driven,
and the tracks tend to have one Zoom call per month with a lot of behind
the scenes coordination going on.</p>
<p>The biggest thing I’ll applaud CaRCC for is their ongoing and
invaluable work in professionalization of the RCD field, which helps
translate RCD roles into job family matrices that I’ve used at Tennessee
Tech, the RCD Nexus organization that puts together workshops and papers
on workforce development and benchmarking your organization against
others, and the RCD Capabilities Model to assist with that benchmarking
and also with identifying the priorities for improving your
organization.</p>
<p>Now those organizations are all virtual, no cost to join, and
extremely welcoming and accessible to new folks.</p>

<p>But if you’re up for some travel, and don’t know where to go to
improve your RCD program or yourself, here’s a couple more options.</p>
<p>The Association for Computing Machinery hosts an annual Practical
Experiences in Advanced Research Computing Conference (PEARC), and this
is by far my top priority conference for the last few years. It’s the de
facto RCD people conference, and with around 800 people in attendance
last year, it’s small enough to where you can meet a lot of people doing
work similar to you, and not get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The conference is a normal academic/professional conference with
paper and presntation tracks, a poster session, and a visualization
showcase where students, faculty, and staff can show off their work and
get ideas to take back with them.</p>
<p>There’s a day of workshops and tutorials on a huge range of topics,
and co-located events frmo CaRCC and RCD Nexus on the Sunday before the
actual conference starts.</p>
<p>Go to PEARC at least once, but as I said previously, it’s on my hot
list every year because of the people that attend.</p>

<p>The Supercomputing conference series is probably the most famous
conference, and it’s pretty far on the other end of the spectrum from
PEARC.</p>
<p>It’s huge, around 14000 attendees last year. Tons of vendors, giant
exhibition space, lots of recruiting for graduate programs, national
labs, etc. One of the two Top 500 lists for fastest HPCs each year is
always announced at SC.</p>
<p>They host a student cluster competition every year, where teams from
all over the world compete to squeeze the most performance out of a
limited power budget and get the best performance on a range of
computational codes.</p>
<p>The SCinet network is also a technical wonder, last year they strung
a lot of miles of cable around the convention center and provided nearly
7 terabits of Internet bandwidth to the attendees and exhibitors.</p>
<p>I haven’t been to SC yet, but should be going to this year’s. From
what I’ve heard, for some people, going once is enough for the spectacle
of everything, but you may find you want to go back repeatedly.</p>

<p>I’m going to break these groups up by what CaRCC calls facings, the
broad categories of work that an RCD professional might be responsible

<p>Researcher facing for the folks that work directly with researchers,

management, archival, and related duties. Software facing for software
development, profiling, and similar. Systems facing for your systems and
network administrators, engineers, and architects. And strategy/policy
facing for the folks that deal with leadership roles, institutional

<p>Data Carpentry is a sibling organization to Software Carpentry. It
focuses on domain-specific training materials in a variety of physical
and social sciences, with some overlap with the Software Carpentry
materials. But it gets to be more focused on what they cover to match
the needs of the specific field.</p>

<p>Library Carpentry focuses on building software and data skills within

people in these roles to use software and data in their own work and to
become advocates for and train others in efficient, effective and

<p>Library Carpentry is more geared for the library and information
professionals. They offer materials on how librarians can get familiar
with software automation so they can promote that elsewhere at their
institution. It’s synergistic with the other Carpentries areas, and can
help your libraries provide a gateway to your RCD services.</p>

<p>For the software-facing folks, the dominant organization in the US is
the US Research Software Engineer Association, or US-RSE.</p>
<p>They’re a very inclusive group where not everyone is expected to be a
professional software developer, but they’re where you want your
developers to be. There’s so much software out there that’s just good
enough to get the job done, but not good enough to scale up or out, and
US-RSE can help there.</p>
<p>Also, US-RSE and the Academic Data Software Alliance collaborated on
a comprehensive career guidebook for data scientists and RSEs that
nicely complements some of what CaRCC does with broader RCD
professionalization. You’ll find a link to that in US-RSE’s Resources
page.</p>

<p>ACM’s SIGHPC Systems Professionals group was the first RCD group I
joined around 2018. I was hired into an enterprise systems
administration group on account of my systems-facing skills, but even
though I’d been running HPCs at smaller scales for several years, SIGHPC
SysPros showed me so much more that I could be doing and let me learn
from others’ mistakes and successes.</p>
<p>Demographically, this group is far from diverse, but it’s very
welcoming and practically un-stumpable on deep systems-related
questions. They have a BOF and a social event every year at PEARC, and
an incredibly active Slack where most of the year-round activity
occurs.</p>

toward those agencies.</p>
<p>There is a membership cost on CASC, unlike most of the rest of the
groups I’ve talked about, and I’ll admit their conferences are not my
comfort zone due to impostor syndrome. But they fill a unique role in
the RCD ecosystem, and I’m grateful they’re doing what I can’t do as

<p>Another externally-facing RCD group is part of EDUCAUSE, which
probably everyone’s central IT group belongs to, even if you’ve never
heard of them. The RCD community group in EDUCAUSE gets a bit farther
afield than other groups in addressing support for the administration of
research rather than the research itself, but they’ve got an interesting
niche between RCD groups and more of the enterprise IT folks.</p>

<p>Finally, the Regulated Research Community of Practice (RRCoP) is the

<p>If your institution is just getting into more sensitive research
areas, especially Department of Defense areas, RRCoP can be an
invaluable sanity check for everyone at your campus. At times, security
measures can go overboard in an abundance of caution, risk management,
and unknowns, but RRCoP has been extremely helpful in gathering what
other more experienced institutions are doing to secure their more
regulated data.</p>
