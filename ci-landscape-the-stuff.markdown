### Who am I? (Who are any of us, really?)

::: {.columns align=center}
::: {.column width=50%}
#### Back in the day
- ME student at a medium-sized public STEM-ish university who should have studied more instead of helping people do things in computer labs.
- Sysadmin/CAD/FEA co-op student at Oak Ridge National Lab before SGI Irix got its cameo in "Jurassic Park" ("It's a Unix system: I know this!").

## Science Gateways

### Science Gateways

::: {.columns align=top}
::: {.column width=80%}

> [Science g]ateways are online interfaces that give researchers, educators, and students easy access to shared resources that are otherwise inaccessible or unaffordable for a large segment of the scientific community.
>
> ...
>
> The SGCI was founded to provide services and resources that advance the state of the art in science gateways, that help gateway creators use accepted practices in developing and operating gateways, and that catalyze the formation of a community that may be diverse in discipline but has a common need to advance science through gateways.
