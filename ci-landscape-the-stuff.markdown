#### Back in the day
- ME student at a medium-sized public STEM-ish university who should have studied more instead of helping people do things in computer labs.
- Sysadmin/CAD/FEA co-op student at Oak Ridge National Lab before SGI Irix got its cameo in "Jurassic Park" ("It's a Unix system: I know this!").
