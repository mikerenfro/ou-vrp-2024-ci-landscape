### Who am I? (Who are any of us, really?)

::: {.columns align=center}

::: {.column width=50%}
#### Back in the day
- ME student at a public STEM-ish university who should have studied more instead of helping people do things in computer labs.
- Co-op student at Oak Ridge National Lab before SGI Irix got its cameo in "Jurassic Park" ("It's a Unix system: I know this!").

### How to make sense of all these groups?

Campus Research Computing Consortium's [facings](https://carcc.org/rcd-professionalization/facings/) (somewhat blurry boundaries, still):

1. Researcher-facing: outreach, advanced application support, co-creating along the research lifecycle
2. Data-facing: data discovery/collection, analysis/visualization, curation, preservation, policy compliance
3. Software-facing: software package management, research software development, optimization
4. Systems-facing: systems administration and operations, networking, architecture, security
5. Strategy- and Policy-facing: leadership, institutional alignment, culture, funding, external partnerships
