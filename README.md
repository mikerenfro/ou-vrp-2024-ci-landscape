# Virtual Residency 2024, "The Cyberinfrastructure Landscape"

Abstract: The diversity, scale and scope of the national CI landscape is sufficiently rich and complex that researchers have to devote time and patience to determine which resource and organizations will best meet their needs. We will explore available organizations, systems, services providers and technologies, while focusing on where and how to access these capabilities.

html_experiment branch in GitHub has HTML output generated from `for f in stuff people; do /usr/local/bin/pandoc --defaults=settings.yaml ci-landscape-the-${f}.markdown -t html -s -o ci-landscape-the-${f}.html; done`

I made enough changes to the settings.yaml and other files to where I won't guarantee the PDFs look right in the `html_experiment` branch. So look ni `main` for good copies of those.
