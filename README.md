# structured-presentation

This template repository and its GitHub Actions will convert a set of Markdown files (`*.markdown`) to Beamer PDFs with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org), including slides with transitions, handouts, and notes pages (in my case, used on a second screen with [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io) on macOS).

It also lets you build your presentation locally with a Makefile.
Currently, the Makefile is fairly Mac-specific, but you can adjust the paths as needed.

Make a new repository using this one as a template, then add your own Markdown files, figures, and other content as needed.
